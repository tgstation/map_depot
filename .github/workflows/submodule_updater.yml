# The reason why we say "Discard Any Changes" is because sometimes, when you merge master in your branch,
# Git may assume that you want to change the submodule commit from whatever is on your machine
# to the one that we have on master. So, this is a helpful reminder to all those who contribute
# that they should discard any changes to this file before they commit. Also, discarding this change
# does mean that you will actually be on the most recent commit in the tgstation submodule.
# If you do not discard your change, your submodule will not be in-date.
